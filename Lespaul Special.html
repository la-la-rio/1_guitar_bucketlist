	<!-- Lespaul Special 소개 -->
	<p class="info">The Gibson Les Paul Special is a variation of the Gibson Les Paul guitar. It was introduced in 1955.Like most of Gibson's other budget models, the Les Paul Special was produced in a TV Yellow finish, which was made by Gibson as a finish that would look good on black and white television. In 1958, the model received a major change when it was introduced as a doublecut model instead of the traditional singlecut.</p>

		<p>
			Slightly higher-end than the Les Paul Jr but still considered a student-level guitar, the Les Paul Special was introduced in 1955 with a pair of P-90 pickups. Like other Les Paul models, the Les Paul Special underwent a total transformation at the end of the '50s. The model has been reissued several times since and remains in production.
