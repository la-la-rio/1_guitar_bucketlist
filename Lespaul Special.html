<p class="info">The Gibson Les Paul Special is a variation of the Gibson Les Paul guitar. It was introduced in 1955.Like most of Gibson's other budget models, the Les Paul Special was produced in a TV Yellow finish, which was made by Gibson as a finish that would look good on black and white television. In 1958, the model received a major change when it was introduced as a doublecut model instead of the traditional singlecut.</p>
